## Crown Clothing

Crown Clothing is a fake shopping site made from a react course on Udemy=> https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/

Demo available [here](https://bbz-crwn-clothing.herokuapp.com/) on heroku (master branch)

I added some features for improvement or just for fun ^^, such as :

* Internalization French/English with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
* [IN PROGRESS] Refactor with Typescript ( was just for fun at start, and i became addicted to TS :P )
* [IN PROGRESS] Removed all ClassComponent & HOC by using Functional Component & Hooks
